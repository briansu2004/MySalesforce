# Salesforce + DataStage

## How to use IBM DataStage to ETL data from various data from a few legacy applications to Salesforce FSC?

IBM DataStage is a powerful ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool that can be used to integrate and transform data from various sources, including legacy applications, and load it into Salesforce Financial Services Cloud (FSC). Here's a general guide on how you might approach this task:

1. **Understand the Data Sources:**
   - Identify and understand the structure of data in your legacy applications. This includes understanding the data types, formats, and any transformations that may be required.
   - Understand the data model of Salesforce FSC and the requirements for data integration.

2. **Install and Configure IBM DataStage:**
   - Ensure that you have IBM DataStage installed and configured in your environment.

3. **Set Up Connections:**
   - Create connections within IBM DataStage to connect to your legacy data sources and Salesforce FSC. DataStage supports a variety of connectors for different databases and systems.

4. **Design DataStage Jobs:**
   - Create DataStage jobs to extract data from your legacy applications. Use the appropriate connectors and stages for reading data.
   - Use transformation stages to clean, filter, and transform the data as needed. This may involve converting data types, aggregating data, or handling any other necessary manipulations.

5. **Salesforce Connector:**
   - Utilize the Salesforce connector in DataStage to load data into Salesforce FSC. You'll need to configure this connector with the necessary credentials and specify the target objects in Salesforce.

6. **Data Quality and Error Handling:**
   - Implement data quality checks and error handling mechanisms in your DataStage jobs. This is crucial to ensure that only clean and valid data is loaded into Salesforce.

7. **Testing:**
   - Test your DataStage jobs thoroughly. Use sample data to verify that the extraction, transformation, and loading processes are working correctly.

8. **Incremental Loading:**
   - Consider implementing incremental loading to update only the changed or new records in Salesforce. This can improve efficiency and reduce the amount of data transferred.

9. **Schedule and Monitor Jobs:**
   - Set up job schedules to run your DataStage jobs at appropriate intervals. Monitor job execution and log files to ensure that data is being transferred successfully.

10. **Documentation:**
    - Document your DataStage jobs, including details on data mappings, transformations, and any other relevant information. This documentation is valuable for troubleshooting and future reference.

Remember that the specifics of your implementation may vary based on the exact requirements of your legacy applications and Salesforce FSC, so be sure to refer to the documentation for both IBM DataStage and Salesforce for detailed guidance. Additionally, consulting with experts in your organization or seeking professional services may be beneficial for complex integrations.

## Salesforce connector - How to connect DataStage to Salesforce FSC?

Connecting IBM DataStage to Salesforce involves using the Salesforce Connector within DataStage. This connector facilitates communication between DataStage jobs and Salesforce, allowing you to read from and write to Salesforce objects. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up the Salesforce Connector in DataStage:

1. **Install Salesforce Connector:**
   - Make sure that the Salesforce Connector is installed and configured in your DataStage environment. The connector is typically installed along with the DataStage client.

2. **Create a Salesforce Connection:**
   - In IBM DataStage, open the DataStage Designer and go to the "Connections" tab.
   - Create a new connection for Salesforce by selecting the Salesforce Connector. You will need to provide the Salesforce connection details, including the Salesforce instance URL, username, password, and security token.

3. **Define Salesforce Metadata:**
   - After creating the Salesforce connection, define the metadata for the Salesforce objects you'll be working with. This includes specifying the Salesforce object (e.g., Account, Contact, Custom Object), fields, and data types.

4. **Use Salesforce Stages in DataStage Jobs:**
   - In your DataStage job, use the Salesforce stages to interact with Salesforce data. The two main stages you'll work with are typically the "Salesforce Input" stage for reading data from Salesforce and the "Salesforce Output" stage for writing data to Salesforce.

5. **Configure Salesforce Input Stage:**
   - When using the Salesforce Input stage, configure it to specify the Salesforce object you want to read data from. You'll also define the query conditions and any other parameters necessary to retrieve the required data.

6. **Configure Salesforce Output Stage:**
   - When using the Salesforce Output stage, configure it to specify the Salesforce object you want to write data to. Map the input fields from your DataStage job to the corresponding fields in the Salesforce object.

7. **Handle Upserts and Inserts:**
   - Depending on your use case, you may need to handle different scenarios such as upserts (update or insert) or inserts only. Configure the Salesforce Output stage accordingly.

8. **Set Bulk Mode for Large Data Volumes:**
   - If you are dealing with large volumes of data, consider setting the Salesforce Output stage to use bulk mode. This can significantly improve the performance of data loading operations.

9. **Test the DataStage Job:**
   - Before deploying your DataStage job to production, thoroughly test it using sample data. Verify that the Salesforce Connector is correctly reading from and writing to Salesforce.

10. **Handle Errors and Logging:**
    - Implement error handling mechanisms in your DataStage job, and ensure that logging is configured appropriately. This will help troubleshoot issues and monitor job execution.

11. **Schedule and Monitor:**
    - Set up job schedules in DataStage Director to run your ETL jobs at the desired intervals. Monitor job execution and logs to ensure that data integration with Salesforce is successful.

Remember to refer to the specific documentation for your version of DataStage and the Salesforce Connector for detailed instructions and best practices. Additionally, stay informed about any updates or changes to the connector that may impact your integration.
